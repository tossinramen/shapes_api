# Shapes API

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e98592ca-3b1d-4709-93c6-7e6aa0dfb84a)](https://shapes.inc/slack)


[Shapes](https://shapes.inc) are general purpose social agents. You can build for an [existing shape](https://shapes.inc/explore) from our catalogue of millions or [create](https://shapes.inc/create) your own. Shapes have rich personalities, love hanging out in groupchats, and short-term + long-term memory across platforms.

The Shapes API enables developers to connect Shapes across social platforms, games, and other applications. Shapes can meet you anywhere, from your favorite social app or a new project. 

## Open Source Contributions
Our API is designed with extensibility as a core principle. You can extend any Shape for tool calling, MCP, and more.

Star and contribute to this repository to receive free hosting for your integration. We will also be directing traffic from our user base to your integration.

## What is the Shapes API?
Shapes API provides a programmatic way to integrate Shapes into any application or platform. It follows the OpenAI-compatible API standard, making it easy to implement with existing libraries and SDKs.

To learn more about implementing Shapes in your app, check out our [examples repository](https://github.com/shapesinc/api).

## Getting Started
You will need to generate an API Key. Every API Key is tied to a specific Shape. Get yours [here](https://shapes.inc/developer)

## Implementation Examples

### 🐍 Python

```python
import openai

shapes_client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<your-API-key>",
    base_url="https://api.shapes.inc/v1/",
)

response = shapes_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="shapesinc/<shape-username>",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
)

print(response)
```

### 🌐 JavaScript

```javascript
const openai = require("openai");

const shapes_client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "<your-API-key>",
    baseURL: "https://api.shapes.inc/v1",
});

const response = await shapes_client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "shapesinc/<shape-username>",
    messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "Hello" }
    ]
});

console.log(response);
```

### 🔄 CURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shapes.inc/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-API-key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "shapesinc/<shape-username>", "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }]}'
